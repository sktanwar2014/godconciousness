              I come from a joint family and got married into a joint family. In my new family, I saw that each one loved to play politics with one another. Saying bad behind someone's back and be sweet in front of them, I couldn't cope with all this and started getting migraines. I always felt I was clear and doing what was right for me! <br />
              After coming into prayers I realised, that my claim of being clear-hearted was filled with ego and feeling of superiority. I became aware of my thoughts and my knowledge of my own self eventually healed my migraine. <br />
              Thank you Di for the prayers. <br />
              I was sowing ego and one up-manship and reaping migraine. <br />
              Thank you for this awakening.<br />

              Please share<br />
                  I conceived after four years of marriage, loads and loads of efforts. I was happy but insecure and very anxious. Was sowing mixed bag of emotions. <br />
                  Insecurities and anxieties out did happiness. I would thank profusely for this conception but at the same time constantly sowed anxiety, fear, doubt, insecurity.<br />
                  Then miscarriage,<br />
                  My world fell apart but it was an amazingly enriching experience. I knew what wrong I had sown. Strange confidence came in me to sow more and more of goodies, good feelings. This miscarriage is my teacher. I understood what Dimple Auntyji says. I knew where I was wrong, what I had sown I started meditations. <br />
                  I started shifting my focus. I started feeling better. This my miscarriage is my teacher, it helped me in all my living. Didn't conceive for next three years, but working on myself continued. <br />
                  Just day before my pregnancy is confirmed. I am at a much better place today. I know this baby will be born healthy and happy. I am so sure. Thank you Dimple Auntyji. Journey of knowing what we want and what we sow. I get results of my sowing instantly. <br />
                  I sow low feel for whatever reason, I get more of it and it comes from anywhere. I sow good feelings and I get the same from anywhere. <br />
                  Sow bad, receive badder, says Auntyji, friends I am living this. <br />
                  Please be alert. I am a living example. I sowed thank you, happiness and anxiety in first conception. Anxiety was more and miscarriage happened, now happiness and gratitude is more and I know I have in my womb healthy and happy Soul. I am confident. <br />
                  Anxiety when it comes, instead of letting it multiply, I wash my face, put on music, start meditation, go for a walk. All directions of Auntyji I follow to the T. <br />
                  Thank you dear Aunty ji for making me the Creator of my life. <br />
                  🙇 Bow Bow Bow Bow to you.<br />
